# Personality-Based Fashion Brand Website

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a multi-page interactive website created as part of a web development assignment. The theme is based on a **for-profit organisation**—a fashion brand that allows users to express their personality and emotions through clothing.

The site concept revolves around **"mood-based fashion"**, where users can take a quiz to find their fashion mood and shop clothing collections that reflect their inner vibe.
