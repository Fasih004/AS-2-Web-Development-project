        <h2>How It All Started</h2>
        <p>
          Wear Your Mood was born from a simple idea: fashion should reflect how you feel. From bold confidence to mellow calm, every piece in our collection is designed to match a mood. We wanted to disrupt basic wardrobes by giving people outfits that *express their true energy*.

        <h2>From the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          "Mood isn’t just a vibe – it’s your identity for the day. That’s why we made a brand that moves with you. It’s not just fashion, it’s a language. I created this for anyone who's ever felt like their clothes should speak louder than their words."
